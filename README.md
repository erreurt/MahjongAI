# README -- MahjongAI

#### Mahjong is a "Constraint satisfaction optimisation" multiplayer strategic board game

This is a project for my master's thesis. Anyone who is interested in making powerful Mahjong AI is welcome to extend my agent. For more details about the applied algorithms and the reasons why such algorithms are used, please contact me with E-Mail. 

In the case that you want to develop your own Mahjong agent, this Repo can also be used as a Framework for realtime testing (***with real human players***). Then you can save all your time for finding the best strategy for your agent. Furthermore a development library (crawling and pre-processing of game logs, calculation of shanten and winning score etc.) is now available in: https://github.com/erreurt/MahjongKit

**Plan**: 1. Decide whether to call a meld/call Riichi or not using Naive Bayes Classifier (Instead of condition-rules).

# Summary
Mahjong is a four player strategy game with imperfect information. The main challenges of developing an intelligent Mahjong agent are for example the complicated game rules, the immense search space, multiple opponents and imperfect information. Several existing works have attempted to tackle these problems through Monte Carlo tree simulation, utility function fitting by supervised learning or opponents model by regression algorithms. Nevertheless, the performance of intelligent Mahjong playing agents is still far away from that of the best human players. Based on statistical analysis for the Mahjong game and human expert knowledge, an intelligent Mahjong agent was proposed in this work. To tackle the problems of the state-of-the-art work, heuristics technologies and an enhanced opponents model achieved by adopting bagging of multilayer perceptrons were applied to this work. The experiments show that the proposed agent outperforms the state-of-the-art agent, and the applied opponents model has a significant positive effect on the performance of the agent. Furthermore, several interesting points can be discerned from the experiments, which are pretty meaningful for future work.

# <a name="res"></a>4. Performance of the proposed Mahjong agent

The proposed Mahjong agent was tested on tenhou.net. The test was carried out in two versions, i.e. one with defence model and another one without. The raw game logs and intermediate game results can be found in my another repository: https://github.com/erreurt/Experiments-result-of-mahjong-bot. The experiments were carried out with the agent version in ***experiment_ai.py***.

### 4.1. Convergence behavior of agent's performance

For the version with defence model, 526 games were played, and for the version without defence model, 532 games were played. This is not as many as two related works, but as shown in the figure of the convergence behavior of agent's performance, 526 games are sufficient.

### 4.2. Agent's performance compared to that of two related works

Mizukami's extended work can be seen as currently the best and the most reliable Mahjong agent in English literatures. Here a comparison between the performance of my Mahjong agent and that of Mizukami's is presented:

   |  | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] |
   | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | Games played | 526 | 532 | 2634 | 1441 |
   | 1st place rate | 23.95% | 22.65% | 24.10% | 25.30% |
   | 2nd place rate | 26.62% | 25.92% | 28.10% | 24.80% |
   | 3rd place rate | 31.75% | 25.71% | 24.80% | 25.10% |
   | 4th place rate | ***17.68%*** | 25.71% | 23.00% | 24.80% |
   | win rate | 24.68% | 26.50% | 24.50% | 25.60% |
   | lose rate | 13.92% | 20.21% | 13.10% | 14.80% |
   | fixed level | 2.21 Dan | 0.77 Dan | 1.14 Dan | 1.04 Dan |

   * ***[2]*** My Mahjong agent ***without*** defence model

Note that while playing Mahjong, falling into 4th place is definitely a taboo, since one would get level points reduced. As a result, the rate of falling into 4th place of a player is critical to its overall performance. My bot has a better fixed level exactly due to the low 4th place rate.

# <a name="run"></a>5. How to run the proposed Mahjong agent?
To run the Mahjong agent, one has to specify a few configurations. As shown in the following example from main.py:
```python
def run_example_ai():
    ai_module = importlib.import_module("agents.random_ai_example")
    ai_class = getattr(ai_module, "RandomAI")
    ai_obj = ai_class()  # [1]
    player_module = importlib.import_module("client.mahjong_player")
    opponent_class = getattr(player_module, "OpponentPlayer")  # [2]
    user = "ID696E3BCC-hLHNE8Wf"  # [3]
    user_name = "tst_tio"  # [4]
    game_type = '1'  # [5]
    logger_obj = Logger("log1", user_name)  # [6]
    connect_and_play(ai_obj, opponent_class, user, user_name, '0', game_type, logger_obj)  # play one game
```

```python
def run_jianyang_ai():
    ai_module = importlib.import_module("agents.jianyang_ai")
    waiting_prediction_class = getattr(ai_module, "EnsembleCLF")
    ensemble_clfs = waiting_prediction_class()
    ai_class = getattr(ai_module, "MLAI")
    ai_obj = ai_class(ensemble_clfs)  # [1]
    opponent_class = getattr(ai_module, "OppPlayer")  # [2]
    user = "ID696E3BCC-hLHNE8Wf"  # [3]
    user_name = "tst_tio"  # [4]
    game_type = '1'  # [5]
    logger_obj = Logger("log_jianyang_ai_1", user_name)  # [6]
    connect_and_play(ai_obj, opponent_class, user, user_name, '0', game_type, logger_obj)

```

1. **AI instance**: A class instance of the Mahjong agent. In this repository three versions of Mahjong agent are provided. The first one is in ***agents.random_ai_example.py***, this is a demo class for showing potential developers how to implement his/her own agents. The second one is in ***agents.experiment_ai.py*** and the experiment results given in part 4 is generated by this AI. The third one is the up-to-date AI and is in ***agents.jianyang_ai.py***.

2. **Opponent player class**: The class of Opponent player. One can use the default class OpponentPlayer in ***client.mahjong_player***. If one has extended the OpponentPlayer class due to extra needs, this variable should be set to your corresponding class.

3. **User ID**: A token in the form as shown in the example that one got after registration on tenhou.net. ***ATTENTION: Please use your own user ID. If the same ID is used under different IP address too often, the account will be temperorily blocked by tenhou.net.***

4. **User name**: The corresponding user name you have created while registrating on tenhou.net. This variable is only for identifying your test logs. 

5. **Game type**: The game type is encoded as a 8-bit integer. Followings are the description for each bit.

    * 0-th: 1 play with online players, 0 play with robots
    * 1-th: 1 no red bonus tiles, 0 with red bonus tiles
    * 2-th: 1 no open tanyao, 0 with open tanyao
    * 3-th: 1 only east+south round (regurarily 8 rounds), 0 only east round (4 rounds)
    * 4-th: 1 three players (two opponents), 0 four players (three opponents)
    * 6-th: 1 fast game (7s for decision making), 0 slow game (15s)
    * 5-th & 7-th: game room 00-starter, 01-upper, 10-mega upper, 11-phoenix
    
    For examples:
    
    * "1" = "00000001": with online real human players, with red bonus tiles, with open tanyao, 4 rounds, 4 players, slow game, starter game room
    * "137" = "10001001": with online real human players, with red bonus tiles, with open tanyao, 8 rounds, 4 players, slow game, upper game room
    * "193" = "11000001": with online real human players, with red bonus tiles, with open tanyao, 4 rounds, 4 players, fast game, upper game room
    
    ```diff
    - Tenhou.net does not provide all possibility of the above specified combinations. Most online players play on configurations for example "1", "137", "193", "9"
    ```

6. **Logger**: Two parameters are required for initialising the logger. The first one is the user-defined logger's ID, such that developers can freely name his/her test history. 

After specifying all these configurations, just throw all these parameters to **connect_and_play()**. Then it's time watch the show of your Mahjong agent!!!

# <a name="dev"></a>6. How to develop your own Mahjong agent?

### 6.1. Output: What functions should be implemented?

Four functions must be implemented for the Mahjong bot, as shown in the "interface" class in ***agents.ai_interface***. It is recommended that your agent is an inheritance of the AIInterface. For a deeper explanation and a simple example of these functions, please see documentation in ***agents.random_ai_example.py***.

```python
class AIInterface(MainPlayer):

    def to_discard_tile(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def should_call_kan(self, tile136, from_opponent):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def try_to_call_meld(self, tile136, might_call_chi):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def can_call_reach(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

   * ***to_discard_tile***: Based on all the accessible information about the game state, this function returns a tile to discard. The return is an integer in the range 0-135. There are toally 136 tiles in the Mahjong game, i.e. 34 kinds of tiles and 4 copies for each kind. In different occasions we use either the 34-form (each number corresponds to one kind of tile) or the 136-form (each number corresponds to a tile). Note that here the return should be in the 136-form.
   
   * ***should_call_kan***: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong#Making_melds_by_calling. This function should decide whether the agent should call a kan(Quad) meld. ***tile136*** stands for the tile that some opponent has discarded, which can be used for the agent to form the kan meld. ***from_opponent*** indicates whether the agent forms the kan meld by opponent's discard (three tiles in hand and the opponent discards the fourth one) or own tiles(all four tiles in hand). 
   
   * ***try_to_call_meld***: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong#Making_melds_by_calling. This function decides whether the agent should call a Pon(Triplet)/Chi(Sequence) meld. ***tile136*** stands for the tile in 136-form that some opponents has discarded. ***might_call_chi*** indicates whether the agent could call a Chi meld, since a Chi meld can only be called with discard of opponent in the left seat.
   
   * ***can_call_reach***: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong#R%C4%ABchi. This function decides whether the agent should claim Riichi.
